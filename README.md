# Hacker's Puzzle

A set of pages to test one's knowledge on common web application vulnerabilities. 
-- *Still under construction* --

This is a project that I started on my own as an excersise in practicing web application security.

Or rather, testing it.

The objective is to advance to the next level in the challenge. However, the means by which someone
reaches the next level will include exploiting a vulnerability found in the current level. Some
levels have multiple ways of reaching the next, but the difficulty will increase as you progress.
